# PHP binaries used by the NativePHP framework

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require nativephp/php-bin --dev
```

or NPM:

```bash
npm -i @nativephp/php-bin --save-dev
```

### ℹ️ Heads up...
> You should install this package as a `dev` dependency, in most cases, and simply copy what you need from it to the
relevant parts of your application. This will save you distributing all of the PHP binaries with every installation.
